# Arrhythmia Detection (Classification)

This project served as my final project for my Data Science bootcamp offered by Lighthouse Labs.

This project is a combination of two of my interests: biomedical engineering and deep learning. Data science plays a crucial role in new and upcoming research in the field of healhcare, from understanding disease mechanisms to improving medical imaging.
